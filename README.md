The developer options I looked into was the pointer location feature.
It seemed as though the developer options had another way to check for user input with the show taps feature.
However I prefered the pointer location feature considering the coordinate system and it was more responsive to actions such as dragging.
I feel as though it would be very useful in situations when whatever I'm creating requires user input from touching the screen which is highly likely to happen.
With this I can gurantee that the way the app is intended to function as it pertains to touching and dragging things is indeed working.
So with that in mind there is a very good chance I use this feature in the future of the course.
